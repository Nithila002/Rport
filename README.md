#### Exploratory Data Analysis 
         Understanding the data by performing exploratory analysis. Viewing the spreadsheet and knowing the variables which allows the prediction model to learn the characteristics of the different types. Using the summary functions and skimr package to provide a glimpse of the overview of the dataset.
#### Data Visualization 
          R Base Plot function for looking deep into dataset in order to graphically and visually have a look at the distribution of the data. 

##### MACHINE LEARNING
#### Classification Model
        Building an own classification model using caret package (represents a collection of machine learning algorithms). Starting from loading the dataset, splitting the dataset, building the training model and cross-validation models using support vector machine, evaluating the prediction performance as well as the feature importance.
#### Model with RDS
             Deploy a machine learning model (a classification model of DHFR dataset) by saving it to disk as RDS file. Then, loading back the model by reading the RDS file and making a prediction on the test dataset. 
#### Handling Missing Data
         Handling the missing data either by simply deleting all entries with missing data or by choosing imputation method (replacing missing values with columnâ€™s mean/median).
#### Speed_Up Model(Parallel Computing)
             Showing that parallel processing could improve  the speed of machine learning model.
